PSEUDO-SUPPORT ABILITIES:  These reaction abilities act more like support
abilities, in that they do not depend on Brave, nor do they require a specific 
trigger to activate -- essentially, they are always active if set.  These are
good choices for low-Brave units.

    [Abandon] - 400 JP, Ninja  
    This ability doubles all inherent, shield, accessory, and weapon evade 
    percentages.  That is, instead of (1 - Ev), each evasion stat contributes a
    multiplier of (1 - 2*Ev) to the success percent equation for evadable 
    attacks.

    [Weapon Guard] - 200 JP, Knight
    This ability enables your weapon evasion (WEv).

DAMAGE-TRIGGERED ABILTIES:  These abilities are triggered if you receive
HP damage (including 0 damage) from any OTHER unit.  They will trigger 
(Brave)% of the time.

    [A Save] - 550 JP, Dancer
    Your PA increases by 1.

    [Auto Potion] - 400 JP, Chemist
    Use a Potion (recovers 30 HP). If you have no Potions in stock, use a 
    Hi-Potion (recovers 70 HP). If you have no Hi-Potions in stock, use an 
    X-Potion (recovers 150 HP). If you have none of these potions in stock, 
    the ability has no effect.

    [Caution] - 200 JP, Thief
    You gain Defending status. This will expire on your next active turn.
     
    [Damage Split] - 300 JP, Calculator
    The unit that damaged you will take RU{damage / 2} damage and you will 
    recover RU{damage / 2} HP. (Will only trigger if damage > 0.)

    [Gilgame Heart] - 200 JP, Thief
    Steal (Damage * 10) gil from the enemy, where Damage is the amount of 
    damage that was just done to you.

    [MA Save] - 450 JP, Bard)
    Your MA increases by 1.

    [Regenerator] - 400 JP, Priest
    You gain Regen status. Like standard Regen, this will expire in 32
    clockticks.

    [Speed Save] - 800 JP, Archer
    Your Speed increases by 1.

COUNTERGRASP:  So called from the two most popular reaction abilities of
this class, Counter and Blade Grasp, these attacks will be triggered by
any of the physical attacks listed below. The attack does not have to
succeed or cause damage in order for the reaction ability to activate.
Like most reaction abilities, these will activate Br% of the time.

           ------------LIST OF COUNTERGRASP ACTIVATORS-------------

          |  ** Vampire version of 'Blood Suck' only!              |
           --------------------------------------------------------

    [Blade Grasp] - 700 JP, Samurai  
    This ability makes the base hit percentage for Countergrasp 
    activators executed against you equal to (Base - YourBr) instead of 
    Base, where Base is the success rate of the attack before evasion
    is considered.  Unlike the other Countergrasp reaction abilities, 
    Blade Grasp DOES work against magic guns.  Blade Grasp can only 
    activate once per attack, so it will at most block one of the two 
    hits from a Two Swords attack.  Blade Grasp is NOT considered to 
    be evasion, and its effects stack with those of evasion. See 
    section 6.6 for details.

    [Brave Up] - 500 JP, Dancer
    Your Br is increased by 3.

    [Counter] - 300 JP, Monk
    If the unit which attacked you is within range of your equipped 
    weapon, you will counter with an ATTACK directive. The Counter-ATTACK
    can't trigger reactions (except pseudo-supports), which means it can't
    be blocked by Blade Grasp.

    [Counter Tackle] - 180 JP, Squire
    If the unit that attacked you is within range of 'Dash', you will 
    counter with 'Dash'.

    [Dragon Spirit] - 560 JP, Lancer  
    You gain Reraise status, unless you already have Reraise or are immune 
    to Reraise.

    [Sunken State] - 900 JP, Ninja 
    You gain Transparent status, unless you are immune to Transparent.

ABILITIES ACTIVATED WHEN IN CRITICAL STATUS:  These abilities will 
activate Br% of the time if you receive HP damage (including 0 damage)
from ANOTHER unit and are in Critical status after that damage 
resolves. It doesn't matter whether you were Critical before the damage 
was dealt.

    [Critical Quick] - 700 JP, Time Mage
    You gain Quick status -- specifically, you are tagged with a critical 
    quick-flag.  This ability can be used to set up 'The Quickening', 
    which allows your units to get infinite turns.  See Shinmen Takazo's 
    excellent Quickening FAQ on gamefaqs.com for details.

    [HP Restore] - 500 JP, Monk
    Restore (your MaxHP - your CurrentHP) HP. (In other words,
    restore your HP to maximum.)

    [Meatbone Slash] - 200 JP, Samurai
    If the attacker is within range of your weapon, you will counter
    with 'Meatbone Slash', a neutral MOD 0 attack that deals damage 
    equal to your Max HP.

    [MP Restore] - 400 JP, Summoner
    Restore (your MaxMP - your CurrentMP) MP. (In other words,
    restore your MP to maximum.)

OTHER REACTION ABILITIES:  These don't fit in any category.

    [Absorb Used MP] - 250 JP, Oracle 
    Whenever another unit uses an ability that costs MP, and you are 
    one of the targets, you have a Br% chance of gaining the amount 
    of MP that the other unit consumed.

    [Arrow Guard] - 450 JP, Archer  
    This is like Blade Grasp, but it only works on bow and crossbow 
    attacks (this includes ATTACK, CHARGE, BATTLE SKILL, and SNIPE, 
    with bow or crossbow equipped).  See 'Blade Grasp'.

    [Catch] - 200 JP, Thief  
    If you are targeted with a THROW attack, you will catch the 
    item and add it to your inventory Br% of the time. The message 
    'Caught' will be displayed in red upon a successful Catch.  
    Mimed THROW attacks cannot be Caught (I guess this is because no 
    'real' item is consumed for a mimed THROW).

    [Counter Flood] - 300 JP, Geomancer  
    If you are targeted by a Counter Flood-enabled attack (Check 
    the big list (section 3.3) to see if an attack is Counter Flood-
    enabled. For the most part, these are Countergraspable attacks 
    that also cause damage, plus ELEMENTAL attacks and some other 
    oddballs), you will counter with an ELEMENTAL directive 
    corresponding to the ground you are currently standing on, 
    regardless of your assailant's distance from you and regardless of 
    whether you have actually learned that ability. The ELEMENTAL 
    directive will have its usual effect area, so if one of your units 
    happens to be standing next to the target of Counter Flood and is 
    on the same height, (s)he'll be damaged too!  Like most reactions, 
    Counter Flood will activate Br% of the time.

    [Counter Magic] - 800 JP, Wizard 
    If you are targeted by a magic gun or a spell that is subject to 
    Counter Magic (see the big list in section 3.3), you will cast that 
    spell back at the caster, paying the appropriate MP cost.  This 
    will activate Br% of the time and only if you have sufficient MP
    to cast the spell.

    [Distribute] - 200 JP, Calculator  
    If you are healed by another unit (this ability does NOT activate if 
    you are healing yourself!), every allied unit that does not have full 
    HP will gain RU{(gained_HP - (maxHP - curHP)) / N}, where gained_HP 
    is the magnitude of the triggering HP gain, maxHP is your maximum HP, 
    curHP was your current HP before the HP gain, and N is the number of 
    allied units that do not have full HP. (In other words, any excess 
    healing will be split equally (round up) among all other party 
    members that are not at full HP.  Note that only one unit's healing 
    will be shown in the animation, but all units that do not have full
    HP will be healed.)  This ability will activate Br% of the time.

    [Face Up] - 500 JP, Bard  
    If you are targeted by any Faith-based magical attack, this 
    ability will increase your Faith by 3. It works Br% of the time.

    [Finger Guard] - 300 JP, Mediator  
    Base success percentage of TALK SKILL attacks executed against 
    you is now equal to (Base% - YourBr%).
       
    [Hamedo] - 1200 JP, Monk  
    If you are targeted by an ATTACK, BATTLE SKILL, THROW, or CHARGE 
    directive and your attacker is within range of your weapon, the 
    attacker's directive will be cancelled and you will instead 
    execute an ATTACK directive on the attacker.  The Hamedo-ATTACK
    cannot trigger reactions (except for pseudo-supports).  Note that 
    this only works on the above-listed commands, which means it is 
    useless on monsters, since they have special forms of physical 
    attack. (And even though Berserk units can only ATTACK, Hamedo
    still doesn't work on Berserked monsters.) This ability will 
    trigger Br% of the time.  Note: unlike Counter, Hamedo will
    activate against spell guns.

    [MP Switch] - 400 JP, Time Mage  
    If you receive HP damage and your CurMP > 0, the damage will 
    instead be dealt to your MP Br% of the time.  This works on 
    almost _any_ source of damage, including Poison, falling damage,
    and self-inflicted damage.  It does not, however, work on damage 
    incurred by other reaction abilities like Hamedo, Counter, and 
    Meatbone Slash.

    [Reflect] - 200 JP, GameShark only  
    This has no effect.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[4.2] support abilities
      =========================================================================

Unlike most reaction abilities, support abilities are always active while 
they are equipped.

[Attack UP] - 400 JP, Geomancer  
For physical attacks except JUMP and some others (see 3.3), the effective 
value of your relevant stat XA = [XA * 4/3].  Usually, XA is PA, but it 
can sometimes be MA (as in a stick ATTACK), Speed (as in a STEAL directive),
or a complex expression like [(PA + MA) / 2] (as in a dictionary ATTACK).  
Check the list in section 3.3 to see whether an attack is physical. 

[Concentrate] - 400 JP, Archer  
Targets cannot evade your physical attacks via their evasion percentages 
(P.CEV, P.SEV, P.AEV, W-EV).  Note that this does not guarantee 100% success 
on attacks such as BATTLE SKILL, since these attacks can still MISS.  Targets 
may also still evade using the 'Blade Grasp' and 'Arrow Guard' abilities.
Concentrate has no effect on magic evasion.

[Defend] - 50 JP, Squire  
Adds the DEFEND command (add: Defending on the caster) to your action menu.

[Defense UP] - 400 JP, Oracle 
For physical attacks except JUMP and some others (see 3.3), units attacking 
you receive a penalty to their relevant stat XA such that XA = [XA * 2/3].
Usually, stat XA is PA, but it can sometimes be MA (as in a stick ATTACK), 
Speed (as in THROW), WP (as in a gun ATTACK), or a complex expression like
[(PA + MA) / 2] (as in a dictionary ATTACK). Check the list in section 3.3 
to see whether an attack is physical.

[Equip Armor] - 500 JP, Knight  
You can equip armor and helmets regardless of your current job.

[Equip Axe] - 200 JP, Squire
You can equip axes regardless of your current job.

[Equip Change] - 0 JP, Chemist
Adds the EQUIP CHANGE command to your action menu.  This allows you to 
change your equipment in battle.  Using EQUIP CHANGE counts as an
action.
  
[Equip Crossbow] - 350 JP, Archer
You can equip crossbows regardless of your current job.

[Equip Gun] - 750 JP, Mediator
You can equip guns (both regular and magical) regardless of your 
current job.

[Equip Knife] - 400 JP, Samurai
You can equip katana regardless of your current job.

[Equip Shield] - 250 JP, Knight
You can equip shields regardless of your current job.

[Equip Spear] - 400 JP, Lancer
You can equip spears regardless of your current job.

[Equip Sword] - 400 JP, Knight
You can equip swords (but not knight swords) regardless of your 
current job.

[Gained Exp-UP] - 350 JP, Calculator
When you receive experience for an action, you receive bonus experience 
such that received Exp = earned Exp * 2.

[Gained JP-UP] - 200 JP, Squire
When you receive JP for an action, you receive bonus JP such that received
JP = [earned JP * 3/2].

[Half of MP] - 900 JP, Summoner
Any MP-using ability costs you half as many MP to use (round up). 
(HalfMPCost = RU{MPCost / 2})

[Magic AttackUP] - 400 JP, Wizard  
For magical attacks, the effective value of your MA = [MA * 4/3].  
This does not include physical attacks (such as stick and staff ATTACK) 
that use MA as their relevant stat. Check the list in section 3.3 to see 
whether an attack is magical. 

[Magic DefendUP] - 400 JP, Priest  
For magical attacks targeting you, the effective value of the caster's 
MA = [MA * 2/3].  This does not include physical attacks (such as stick and
staff ATTACK) which use MA as their relevant stat. Check the list in section
3.3 to see whether an attack is magical. 
 
[Maintenance] - 250 JP, Chemist
Your equipment cannot be stolen or broken.  Any attack that steals or 
breaks equipment will have a 0% success rate if targeted against you.

[Martial Arts] - 200 JP, Monk
Your effective XA for all physical attacks except JUMP and THROW is equal 
to [XA * 3/2].  If you are not barehanded, those physical attacks that 
are weapon-elemental (ATTACK, CHARGE, BATTLE SKILL, SNIPE, sword skills) 
will not receive the bonus.

[Monster Skill] - 200 JP, Squire
Monsters standing on squares adjacent to you will have access to a new 
skill (vertical tolerance 3).  This will have no effect if you are
Berserk, Confused, or Unable to Fight.

[Monster Talk] - 100 JP, Mediator
Enables you to target TALK SKILL on monsters, regardless of your job.

[Non-charge] - 3000 JP, GameShark only
All slow actions, except for JUMP, CHARGE, SING, and DANCE, become fast 
actions.

[Secret Hunt] - 200 JP, Thief
If you kill a monster with damage from your weapon (i.e., through ATTACK, 
CHARGE or Counter), you will poach it; that is, it will be transformed 
into an item that you can buy at one of the Fur Shops located around Ivalice.
Items bought at the Fur Shop will be half their normal price! Also, you can
sell any item to the Fur Shop to raise some quick cash, and then later buy 
it back for the same amount you sold it for!

[Short Charge] - 800 JP, Time Mage
For all slow actions except for JUMP, CHARGE, SING and DANCE, 
ctr = RU{ctr/2}.

[Throw Item] - 350 JP, Chemist 
Range of ITEM becomes 4/1 (line of sight), regardless of your current job.

[Train] - 450 JP, Mediator  
If you strike a monster directly with your weapon (e,g., through ATTACK, 
CHARGE, or Counter), and that monster is Critical after the attack 
resolves, you will also add: Invite to that same monster.

[Two Hands] - 900 JP, Samurai
You are able to grip one-handed weapons with both hands, doubling 
weapon power (does not apply to non-striking weapons like guns and 
crossbows).  Weapon power is doubled for the ATTACK command only and 
does not affect other physical attacks -- even those that employ weapons 
such as JUMP, BATTLE SKILL, HOLY SWORD, DARK SWORD and MIGHTY SWORD. 
(It does apply, however, to the ATTACK that results from targetting a 
BATTLE SKILL on a piece of equipment that the target does not have.)

[Two Swords] - 900 JP, Ninja  
You are able to equip two one-handed weapons at once.  This has some 
interesting upshots -- for instance, all BATTLE SKILL, CHARGE, and 
SNIPE directives are executed twice if you are carrying two weapons.
In addition, if you attack a target that has Blade Grasp set, 
Blade Grasp can only block one of the two hits that you incur.  If
the first hit of a Two Sworded attack fails to connect for any 
reason (evade, Blade Grasp, or inherent inaccuracy of the attack), 
then the target will turn to face the attacker prior to the second 
hit, and the second hit will be treated as if it were executed 
from the front (i.e., all possible evade parameters will be 
considered).


_______________________________________________________________________________
[4.3] movement abilities
      =========================================================================

Movement abilities allow you to move about the battlefield more easily, or
activate special powers when you move.

[Any Ground] - 220 JP, Geomancer 
Normally each square of flowing water you walk through costs you two movement 
points instead of one.  With this ability, the movement penalty to walk through
flowing water vanishes.

[Any Weather] - 200 JP, Oracle
Normally, you can walk over marsh sqaures without suffering the water penalty.
However, if it is raining heavily in a marshland, you will face a similar 
penalty -- you must use two movement points for every square of marsh you 
move over.  If you have Any Weather equipped, that penalty will not take 
effect.  In addition, weather effects on magic (increase in Lightning damage 
and decrease in Fire damage during thunderstorms) are nullified if the caster
has Any Weather.  This is in a heated battle with Move on Lava for the title
of 'most useless ability'. And another curiosity:  the programmers gave the 
Steel Giant class Any Ground and Any Weather inherent, but they also gave 
it Cannot enter water inherent, making Any Ground and Any Weather completely
useless! Maybe they intended to program more weather and terrain effects 
into the game but never got around to it.

[Cannot enter water] - 200 JP, inherent for several monsters)
You cannot move or stop on squares that are submerged in water.

[Float] - 540 JP, Time Mage 
You float 1h above the ground. This has the same effect as the Float status,
except that it allows you to stop on lava squares (the Float status only 
allows you to move, not stop, over lava).

[Fly] - 1200 JP, Bard and Dancer
Allows you to fly over all height differences, enemies, and obstacles.
Nullifies fall damage.

[Ignore Height] - 700 JP, Lancer
You are able to jump to any vertical height, regardless of your 'Jump' 
stat.  This has no effect on the Lancer's JUMP command.

[Jump +1] - 200 JP, Archer
'Jump' stat + 1.  This has no effect on the Lancer's JUMP command.

[Jump +2] - 480 JP, Thief  
'Jump' stat + 2.  This has no effect on the Lancer's JUMP command.

[Jump +3] - 1000 JP, Dancer
'Jump' stat + 3.  This has no effect on the Lancer's JUMP command.

[Move +1] - 200 JP, Squire
'Move' stat + 1.

[Move +2] - 520 JP, Thief
'Move' stat + 2.

[Move +3] - 1000 JP, Bard
'Move' stat + 3.

[Move in Water] - 420 JP, Ninja
You can move (and stop) on top of water; water is treated like 
normal ground.

[Move on Lava] - 150 JP, Geomancer
You can move (and stop) on top of lava; lava is treated like 
normal ground.

[Move Undrwater] - 200 JP, inherent for Mindflayer type monsters 
You can move (and stop) in water up to 3h deep without penalty. 

[Move-Find Item] - 100 JP, Chemist
You can extract hidden items from booby-trapped squares without
triggering the traps. Each square has two items: the odds of getting
one (usually the commoner item) are Br%, and the odds of getting the
other (usually the rarer item) are (100 - Br)%.

[Move-Get Exp] - 400 JP, Calculator
You gain 1 Exp. per panel moved, unless you are afflicted with 
Berserk, Confusion, or Blood Suck status.

[Move-Get JP] - 360 JP, Calculator
You gain 2 JP per panel moved, unless you are afflicted with 
Berserk, Confusion, or Blood Suck status.

[Move-HP Up] - 300 JP, Monk
Recover RU{MaxHP / 10} HP if you move at least one panel, unless 
you are afflicted with Berserk, Confusion, or Blood Suck status.

[Move-MP Up] - 350 JP, Oracle
Recover RU{MaxMP / 10} MP if you move at least one panel, unless 
you are afflicted with Berserk, Confusion, or Blood Suck status.

[Silent Walk] - 700 JP, GameShark only
No known effect.

[Teleport] - 600 JP, Time Mage
Able to teleport through obstacles, height differences, units, etc.  
Chance of success is 100% within your Move range and decreases 10% 
per extra square you move.  See section 6.7 for details.

[Teleport 2] - 0 JP, inherent for Arch Angel, Holy Angel 
Teleport anywhere on the battlefield with 100% success.

[Walk on Water] - 300 JP, Samurai
Ignore water depth; all water is treated like it is 1h deep, 
regardless of actual depth. (Doesn't it seem like this should be
called Move in Water, and Move in Water should be called 
Walk on Water?)
